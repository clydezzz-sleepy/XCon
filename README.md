# The XCon Console
Yes, just a simple console you might use once in a while.
The XCon Console is used just like the command prompt is and has many handy commands you might use to good results.
- Warning: *Please* don't try to delete anything protected or sensitive on your local machine, or XCon will exit by itself.
- For the rest, this console is used for pure fun and physically does nothing more than what the Windows Command Prompt does.
- Either way, have fun!
